        <p class=title> Pseudo Elements and Pseudo Class Selectors</p>
        <article>
             
            <h3>Pseudo-classes - ‘fake’ classes</h3>
            <p>Are preceded by a `:`, usually come into play when a user performs an action on the page, and are created with CSS.
            </p>
            <p> 
                For instance we can see the following classes.
               <br> nth-of-type: selects one or more elements, within a parent’s list of children, based on their source order, often according to a given formula(an+b). Assists in the selection of something that cannot be expressed by a simple selector, 
               <br> nth-last-child: matches elements within a group of those elements’ siblings, counting from the end element of that specific group.
               <br> first-of-type / last-of-type: the first or last element of its type among a group of sibling elements
                <br>Link-related pseudo-classes: a group of pseudo-classes that are related directly to a user’s interaction with elements on the page such as the button or a elements.:visited — a link that a user has already visited , :link — the actual link within the html tag, :hover — the action of a user interacting with an element via a “pointing device”, and  :activeclass — represents an element that is being activated by the user. Key point : those need to be written in CSS in a specific order of - :link — :visited — :hover — :active.
            </p>
            <p>In general there are :- Dynamic pseudo-classes [ :link, :visited , :hover, :active, :focus]
                UI element states pseudo-classes [ :enabled , :disabled, :checked]
                Structural pseudo-classes [ :first-child, :nth-child(n, :nth-last-child(n) , :nth-of-type(n) ,:nth-last-of-type(n)
                , :last-child , :first-of-type , :last-of-type , :only-child , :only-of-type , :root , :empty]
                Other pseudo-classes [ :not(x) , :target , :lang(language) ].
            </p>
            <h3>Pseudo-elements - ‘fake’ elements </h3>
            <p>on the other hand, are key words, like virtual elements that are treated more similarly to regular HTML elements. Allows us to create items that don’t exist on the document tree or DOM either, and can also be created with CSS selectors to style a specific part of a selected element.This introduces huge benefits for creating cool effects with minimal markup, also aiding significantly in keeping the presentation of the document out of the HTML and in CSS where it belongs.
                Unfortunately animations and transitions on pseudo elements are buggy or not implemented at the moment in most browsers.
            </p>
            <p> 
                For instance we can see the following classes.
               <br> ::before / ::after: allows us to insert “virtual” elements before or after an element’s content that the user can see and are able to be styled in the CSS
               <br>::first-letter: styles only the first letter of the first line of a block-level element.<br> first-of-type / last-of-type: the first or last element of its type among a group of sibling elements
                <br>::first-line: styles only the first line of a block-level element.
            </p>

        <p class=title>Demo of How Grid Layout  Works in CSS3</p>
        <article>
            <p>
                CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS.
                It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows,
                unlike flexbox. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules 
                both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) 
                and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).
            <p>
            <p>
                In my demo I have used Grid layout to create a simple responsive design web page. <br>
                Click<a target="_black" href="gridDemo.html"> here</a> to see the demo.

        <p class=title>Flexbox and Grid Layout</p>
        <article>
            <p>Dimensions define the primary demarcation between Flexbox and CSS Grid. </p>
            <h3>Flexbox Layout</h3>
            <p>designed as a one-dimensional presentation model and as a 
                method that can provide space distribution between interface elements and
                powerful alignment functions. When we describe the flexbox as one-dimensional, 
                we describe the fact that flexbox processes layouts in one dimension at a time, 
                as a row or column.</p>
            <p> 
                Popular among front-end developers, since it allows developers to 
                create multiple instances of dynamic layouts and effortlessly align content
                within containers by enabling to position responsive elements appropriately 
                within screens of different sizes. Performance issues can be stated as one of
                it's disadvantage while supporting all browsers is top of it's pros.</p>
            <p> - is designed for one-dimensional layouts.
                <br> - allow a flex container to wrap
                <br> - approach is primarily the content.
                <br> - is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts 
            </p>
            <h3>Grid Layout</h3>
            <p>Aligns items in columns and rows, allowing developers to easily control 
                the rendering and appearance of large layouts and whole pages meant for
                the desktop, tablet, and smartphone displays. It offers automation to create a layout, 
                or define automatic placement rules that perform placements inside a given grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Making file sizes reduced and having fast and efficient prototyping is a 
                huge advantage while not being supported by every browser is it's drawback.
                Opera Mini, Blackberry Browser, QQ Browser, and Baidu Browser does not support Grid.

                </p> 
                
            <p> - Is designed for two-dimensional layouts
                <br> - The approach is the layout first
                <br> - Getting elements to overlap 
                <br> - is designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design
            </p>
            <p>
                Infact, combining them together results in a more 
                lightweight setup by utilizing their respective strengths to create an
                 extremely fluid, customizable, beautiful, smooth, and simple experience.
